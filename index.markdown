Hi, my name is Sebastian Wolf. I work as a CPU performance developer technology engineer.

Before that, I did my doctorate at the Technical University of Munich. 
I worked on the HPC earthquake simulator [SeisSol](https://github.com/SeisSol/SeisSol).
Also, have a look at [my page at TUM](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/sccs/personen/sebastian-wolf/).
